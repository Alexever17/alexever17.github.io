No coding today, just played danganronpa the whole day, but it is such a meaningful game that i feel like it was totally worth it. It deals with a lot of the bad sides of the human nature

Oh yeah, silvester log fellas xD
Personally i am quite happy to finish 2017 and finally transition to 2018. I want to make 2018 a really amazing year and the overarching theme is "self-improvement".
I want to be a lot harder on my sepf this year and have a healthier mental attitude and slack a lot leas of. And just keeping me healthier than in 2017.
It was indeed a nice fun day but also a lot of reflection and the first year i am setting myself those january resolutions haha
I used to lock down on them, but i think if it is something realistical it should be doable
For the next month those are the 4 one hour areas i want to improve:

//// Spend 1 hour everyday for my university studies after the day/lectures - I hope to reduce my stress in exam weeks

//// 1 hour of actual english learning. I am not bad but i really want to get to a native level.
And what i mean is not exposing myself to the language by watching movies in english or something but reall studying, like grammer or something (tips welcomed, i have never properly studied a language before haha)

//// 1 hour of learning chinese, my university degree and my cultural background are literary screaming at me to learn a 4th language and i enjoy different cultures quite a lot, so its either chinese or japanese for me. For now chinese is easier to find courses so lets try this our

//// 1 hours of coding everyday, though i am not starting a 100daysofcode challenge or whatever the trendy hashtag is because my life is stressful enough then to think:"Oh no, i cant go out and do this because i havent finished my balbal hour!"
So yeah just would like to end up with a nice amount learned in 2018

Sorry for such a textwall, its just a nice and convenient round up of my thoughts from this day^^
(And for the mistakes, was tipped on the phone -.-)

01.01.2018:
great start into the year with some 4 hours of coding today

02.01.2018:
fixed some things in the game and included it into my portfolio
